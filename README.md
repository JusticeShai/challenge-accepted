# challenge-accepted
A working solution (valid input and output will be provided) and supporting tests using a language of your choice.

The input and output will be text. Either using stdin/stdout or taking filenames on the command
line is fine.

To compile, go to src/project directory and type:
`javac App.java` on terminal and press enter
then type
`java App sample.txt` on terminal and press enter

To run the tests, uncomment the code in Main.java's `main` method.
This code has limitations, a funny flaw but it is mostly in the printRanking method. Given enough time I could grapple with it but this is as far as I could get it to function.
